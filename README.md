# Welcome on my Github !

My name Timoth√©e (aka Redshark). I'm 18 yo and I'm from France.  
I'm a young web developer and I really want it to be my job.  
I learnt everything by my self, using some video on Youtube, or by following free online courses (such as OpenClassroom in France).
I work alone, but if it's necessary, I can work with other people.

## Some stats about me :

![My different stats](https://github.com/Redshark61/Redshark61/blob/master/generated/overview.svg)
![My most used languages](https://github.com/Redshark61/Redshark61/blob/master/generated/languages.svg)  
As you can see, I mostly use *PHP*, *CSS* and *Js*. I recently turned to *Scss*, and I planed to learn *React* in the near future.  

## What are my skills ?
I dont only know web programing languages, I also learnt :
* C++ (damn that's so hard  :disappointed_relieved:)
* Python
* Flutter
* Java

I create my own website design, and I'll __never__ (ever) use Bootstrap (except if my boss fire me if I dont). It's not that hard to create our own website, is it ?  
To make my design I'm using figma, and sometimes I create my own logo (such as Instagram, or thumbnail).  

## My work :
I made my own website : [Beredy](https://beredy.tk). Everything here is made by myself (I'm quite proud of me :smile:). You can check out the [source code](https://github.com/Redshark61/site_perso) on my github.  
I also helped a [friend](https://github.com/HerbeMalveillante) to create his [website](http://notebac.rf.gd/). My friend made an algorithm to calculate it, and I created the design. 

## How to contact me :
 You dont contact me, I'm the one who contact you...  :smiling_imp:
