# Welcome on my Github

My name Timoth√©e (aka Redshark). I'm 18 yo and I'm from France.  
I'm a young web developer and I really want it to be my job.  
I learnt everything by my self, using some video on Youtube, or by following free online courses (such as OpenClassroom in France).
I work alone, but if it's necessary, I can work with other people.

## Some stats about me

I mostly use _PHP_, _CSS_ and _Js_. I recently turned to _Scss_, and I planed to learn _React_ in the near future.

## What are my skills

I dont only know web programing languages, I also learnt :

- C++
- Python
- Flutter
- Java

I create my own website design, and I'll **never** (ever) use Bootstrap (except if my boss fire me if I dont). It's not that hard to create our own design, is it ?  
To make my design I'm using figma, and I can create my own logo (such as Instagram, or thumbnail).

## My work

I made my own website : [Tcode](https://tcode.fr). Everything here is made by myself (I'm quite proud of me :smile:). You can check out the [source code](https://github.com/Redshark61/site_perso) on my github.
